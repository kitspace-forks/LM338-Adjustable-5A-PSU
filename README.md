# LM338 1.8V-30V 5A Linear PSU

This repository contains EagleCAD PCB files for a 5 Amp adjustable voltage linear power supply using the LM338 IC. Output is adjustable between 1.8V and 30V; the input voltage must be at least 5V above the desired output voltage. Theoretically the design is capable of up to 150 watts power, but the LM338 will require proper cooling.

This design is based on the _Adjustable Regulator With Improved Ripple Rejection_ design found on page 18 of the Texas Instruments LM338 [datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm338.pdf).

This work was originally created in 2013 but is now being published here under the MIT licence.
